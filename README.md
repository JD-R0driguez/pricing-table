#Learning Goals

In this project, I used CSS Flexbox to create a pricing table layout. Through this project, I have learned about several Flexbox properties that are commonly used in web development.

One of the properties I learned about is flex-grow. This property allows you to specify how much an element should grow in relation to the other flex items in the container. I used this property to make sure that the pricing plans were evenly distributed across the container.

Another property that I used is flex-shrink. This property specifies how much an element should shrink in relation to the other flex items in the container. By default, all flex items have a shrink factor of 1, which means they will all shrink equally if necessary. In my project, I didn't need to use this property.

The third property I learned about is flex-basis. This property specifies the initial size of a flex item before any remaining space is distributed. I used this property to set the initial height of each pricing plan.

Finally, I also used media queries in my project. Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the device or screen size. I used a media query to adjust the layout for screens with a maximum width of 1250 pixels, which allowed the pricing plans to stack vertically instead of horizontally. This made the pricing table more readable on smaller screens.

Overall, this project was a great way to practice using CSS Flexbox properties and media queries to create a responsive layout.
